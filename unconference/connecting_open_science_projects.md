## Why?

The open source community is so big, with countless projects, it is a challenge to stay informed. Many projects remain unknown unless they are showcased at events or through grant proposals. This lack of visibility makes it difficult for community members to discover, connect, and collaborate effectively.

## Solution

We propose a centralized platform with a searchable dataset and news feed to improve the discoverability of the projects. This could share key information such as goals, contributor needs, and progress updates, allowing developers and users to easily find and connect with initiatives. This centralized hub would foster collaboration and improve visibility across the community.

This platform will allow users to search for projects based on their interests, skills, and availability. It will also provide a space for project owners to showcase their work, share updates, and find collaborators.

## Outcomes

We created a form and an initial version of the platform using Google Forms, Google Sheets and quarto. The form collects information about the projects, such as the project name, description. The responses are then stored in a Google Sheet, which can be used to create a searchable dataset of the projects.

The repository for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenScienceLabs/connecting-osp).

### Form

The questions on the Google Form were designed around key information that anyone might need to know about the projects. The form is divided into sections, each about project details. This structure allows project owners to provide a comprehensive overview of their project, making it easier for users to find and connect with other initiatives.

#### What we need to know about projects?

This form collects key information about your project for publication on a website resulting from the DISC Unconference 2025. The data provided will allow others to explore and learn about different projects. We appreciate your contribution to making this initiative a reality.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Write contributors guidelines
- [ ] Improve the design and functionality of the platform
- [ ] Automatization of the protocol to update platform
- [ ] Deploy the platform in GitHub Pages
- [ ] Send form to open source projects to start populating the database
- [ ] Develop a news feed feature to keep users informed about project updates
- [ ] Implement a search functionality to help users find relevant projects
- [ ] Enable translation of the platform into other languages.
